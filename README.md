# Gluon

Gluon is a tool for creating and finding releases based on Git commit history, using Conventional Commits and Semantic Versioning.

It is meant for use both from a user's desk and invoked from Continuous Integration pipelines.

Gluon is currently under active development. Try running the `help` command for some usage examples.
